RoseBot is an engaging Telegram bot built with Python using the asynchronous **aiogram** framework and **MongoDB** for persistent data storage. The bot features interactive game mechanics centered around growing and managing virtual flowers like roses and peonies.

## âœ¨ Features

*   **Interactive Game Mechanics:** Engage users with a unique flower-growing game.
*   **Asynchronous & High-Performance:** Built on `aiogram` to handle many users concurrently without blocking.
*   **Persistent Data Storage:** User progress, inventory, and settings are securely stored in a MongoDB database.
*   **Modular and Clean Code:** The project is organized into logical modules for easy maintenance and scalability.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The repository is structured to separate concerns, making the codebase clean and understandable.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine or server.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   Git
*   A MongoDB database instance (local or cloud-based like MongoDB Atlas)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/regw1d/RoseBot.git
cd RoseBot
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python libraries. It's best practice to have a `requirements.txt` file. You can create one with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file yet, install the core libraries:
```bash
pip install aiogram pymongo python-dotenv
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project and add the following configuration.

```env
# Get this token from @BotFather on Telegram
BOT_TOKEN="123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11"

# Your MongoDB connection string
MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
MONGO_DB_NAME="RoseBotDB"
```
**Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control! Add it to your `.gitignore` file.

### 5. Run the Bot

Execute the main script to start the bot.

```bash
python rosebot.py
```

## Usage

Once the bot is running, you can interact with it on Telegram. Here are some example commands (you should update this section with your actual commands):

*   `/start` - Check bot work.
*   `/rose` - Get roses on your balance.
*   `/help` - Get a list of available commands.
